The design of a high speed CMOS image sensor

CMOS - Stands for "Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor." It is a technology used to produce integrated circuits. CMOS circuits are found in several types of electronic components, including microprocessors, batteries, and digital camera image sensors.

High speed imagers find applications in many fields such as scientific and medical imaging, automotive applications, machine vision and much more. In this thesis, the design of a high speed, high dynamic range (HDR) CMOS sensor with electronic global shutter (GS) and flexible exposure control is presented. The sensor is designed in the 0.11µm CIS process, features 1k(H) x 1k(V) pixels and achieves framerates greater that 10.000 fps. A review of the architecture of the sensor is given, along with functional illustrations for each comprising block. The quadrant-based approach is described, along with the selectable region-of-interest capability. The pixel design is a eleven-transistor (11T) pinned photodiode global shutter pixel, implementing HDR by means of two in-pixel capacitors. The design of the pipelined Sample & Hold, column gain and column-level Correlated Double Sampling (CDS) circuits are shown.
